//! `CoreError` — the unified error surface of the assembly layer.
//!
//! `opentake-core` orchestrates three lower layers, each with its own error
//! type: editing ([`opentake_ops::EditError`]) and persistence
//! ([`opentake_project::ProjectError`]). This enum folds them into one type the
//! Tauri command surface (and the in-app agent) can map uniformly, and adds the
//! handful of conditions that only exist at the assembly level (no project open,
//! a backend that is not wired yet).
//!
//! The split between [`CoreError::Edit`] (a *validation* failure — the caller's
//! input was rejected, the document is untouched) and [`CoreError::Internal`] /
//! [`CoreError::Project`] (an IO / decode failure) mirrors the `code:
//! "validation"` vs `code: "internal"` distinction in `core-SPEC.md` §6.3.
